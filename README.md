# Word-Guess-Game

## Table of Contents 

## Objective 

Created a word guess game based on Tim Burton films.  The primary objective was practice constructors to have modularized code. 

## Code Structure

The app was broken down into three javascript files (letter.js,word.js,main.js).  The letter.js file constructs the true or false value for each letter in the word and correctly displays the appropriate string value in the console.  The word.js file holds the letter objects that make up the entire word.  The main.js is the game logic that takes in a user guess and passes it down to the word.js file, and then to the letter.js file to determine if the guess was correct.
